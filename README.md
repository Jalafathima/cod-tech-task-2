Overview of the Temperature Conversion Project
This project is a C-based command-line application designed to facilitate the conversion of temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It serves as an educational tool and a practical resource for users needing quick temperature conversions.

**Objectives**
**Temperature Conversion:**
Provide accurate conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

**User-Friendly Interface:**
Allow users to easily input temperature values and scales, and specify their desired output scale.

**Error Handling:**
Ensure the program can gracefully handle invalid input and inform users appropriately.

**Educational Value:**
Help users understand the relationships between different temperature scales.

**Key Activities**
**Requirements Gathering:**
Identify the necessary features for the temperature conversion tool.

**Design:**
Outline the program structure, including functions for conversion logic and user interaction.

**Implementation:**
Write the C code to handle temperature conversion, user input, and output.

**Testing:**
Verify that the program works correctly with various input values and scales, including edge cases.

**Documentation:**
Create user guides and inline comments in the code for clarity and future maintenance.

***Technology Used***
**Programming Language:**

**C:** The project is developed in C for its efficiency and close-to-hardware capabilities.

**Development Environment:**
A standard C compiler (e.g., GCC) is used for compiling the program.

**Version Control:**
Git (optional): For managing changes and maintaining code versions.

**Documentation Tools:**
Plain text files or markdown for documentation and user guides.

**Conclusion**
The Temperature Conversion Project successfully achieves its objectives by providing a straightforward and efficient way to convert temperatures between different scales. The use of C as a programming language ensures that the application is both fast and efficient. Through this project, users gain valuable insights into temperature relationships, and the program can be a stepping stone for further enhancements, such as adding a graphical user interface or extending the functionality to include additional units of measurement. This project not only serves a practical purpose but also offers an educational experience in programming and thermodynamics.
